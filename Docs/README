Two possible approaches...
o Run 'chroot_build_image'.  It will do everything for you and dump a ready for use image in /tmp/AOK
OR...
o Download, import and boot from the latest Alpine i386 miniroot, or use the included iSH miniroot
o The unzip binary is included with either of the above mentioned filesystems so it is probably easiest
  to download a zip'd version of this repository to your iCloud drive somehow
o You can mount your iCloud drive in iSH via the following command...
  mount -t ios foo /mnt
o Navigate to where the zip file is and do the following...
  unzip AOK-main.zip
  cd AOK-main
  ./build_image
o Restart and you should be good to go.
